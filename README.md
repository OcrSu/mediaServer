This is a simple website that provides web access to videos on a web server.

Videos should be located in the resources folder, ideally using symbolic links to a file server on the network. Different folders can be accessed using ?dir=foldername after the website's url. The default folder is defined on the second line of index.php as RESOURCE_DEFAULT.
